# ``HomomorphicEncryptionProtobuf``

Protocol buffer support for Homomorphic Encryption (HE)

## Overview
`HomomorphicEncryptionProtobuf` contains supports for using `HomomorphicEncryption` (HE) with [protocol buffers](https://protobuf.dev/), commonly referred to as `protobuf`.
This module contains:
* the generated Swift code to use the protobuf types.
* conversion between protobuf types and `HomomorphicEncryption` runtime types.

The protobuf schemas are defined at [https://github.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption-protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption-protobuf).
